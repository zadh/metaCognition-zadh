While everyone has heard about the differences between visual, auditory, reading and kinesthetic learners, most don't realize that studies have consistently shown that those categories make little to no difference while learning. Instead, they point to something else entirely: the difference between a Rule learner and an Example learner.

(**you'll be learning about those two individually in linked chapters.**)

You want to make sure that the message comes out of it stays with you. So, what do we do and how do we do it? One of the first things that we have to get past is the fact that we tend to rely on our own preferences when it comes to how we illustrate or provide evidence to the idea. if you like stories, you tell stories, if you like research and data, you use more research and data.

Now, you may have learned about the four learning styles: visual, auditory, reading and kinesthetic, where people touch and move things. It has been found over and over again that regardless of how the information is presented, people learn the same. They may prefer to learn by visual or listening or reading or touch and moving things but they will learn the same.

Well, what is going on here?

Go to "Rule Learners" and "Example Learners" to Learn more.

There are a lot more learning styles to understand or grasp a concept, not just 1 or 2 but many and I'll be trying find as many as possible.
