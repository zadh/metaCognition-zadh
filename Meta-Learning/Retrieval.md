What is Retrieval?

This is one of the most important stages in learning, the act of retrieving the information or knowledge they are learning is known as "Retrieval learning". It is any method that requires to think and bring the information and knowledge they are learning to the forefront of the mind. There are many ways to retrieve the information, these are a few: Flashcards, quiz, a little homework, and trying to memorize or remember the list of things, and of course asking ourselves a few questions to test how much we have learned.

Several students tend to make mistakes when practising with flashcards, However, you can help to improve the deepness of your learning by avoiding these 3 common mistakes. 

# *MISTAKE 1*:
More often, students look at the front and back in a flashcard and the "*answer*" looks familiar to them, and they think they remember it all, however, in reality, they are being tricked by their brain to think they know it, Instead, they are being prompted to it.

## *MISTAKE 2*:
Frequently, students think that the act of creating their flashcards is what the process of "**Learning**" is. Once they make it, they do not look back at them anymore. Their confidence in knowing the information is a brain-trick, it is proven by our Learning Scientists that students who practise "Retrieval Learning" are far better in tests than students who do not.

### *MISTAKE 3*:
Much of the time, students feel that they learned the information once they go through it accurately, then they stop.

Making yourself aware of these misconceptions can help you avoid them.
it's always better to be clear and confident than know nothing yet confident.
