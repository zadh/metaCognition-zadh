What is Interleaving?

In Interleaving, one mixes, interleaves, practise on several related skills together.

**Interleaved practice** â€“ when you are learning two or more related concepts or skills, instead of focusing exclusively on one concept or skill at a time, it can be helpful to alternate between them (for example, if you are learning topic A and topic B, rather than practice only A on one day and only B on the next, you can practice both on each day by incorporating a mixture of the two topics or by switching back and forth between them). Examples of materials that interleaved practice can benefit include similar types of math problems (for example, calculating volumes of different shapes), easily confused grammatical tenses

Interleaving is a process where students mix, or interleave, multiple subjects or topics while learning in order to Improve their Learning.

Blocked practise on the other hand, where you study one subject or a topic thoroughly before moving to the other might look the best way to better learning but that is where you are wrong about it. You might think the strongest path possible lasts as long as possible. In order to make a good path, you have to make the most effort. Here you might get a doubt that studying one topic completely, is tougher, the answer is no, studying multiple subjects or topics is a lot harder and takes a lot more effort and much effort boosts your learning.

Interleaving has shown to be more effective than blocked practise for developing skills of categorization and problem-solving: Interleaving also leads to better long-term retention and improved ability to transfer learned knowledge. This strategy forces the brain to continually retrieve, for a reason that each practise is different from the last, so rote responses pulled from short-term won't work. Since interleaving involves retrieval practise, it is more difficult than blocked practise.
