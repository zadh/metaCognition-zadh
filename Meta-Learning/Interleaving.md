What is Interleaving?

Interleaving is a process where students mix, or interleave, multiple subjects or topics while learning in order to Improve their Learning.

Blocked practise on the other hand, where you study one subject or topic thoroughly before moving to the other might look the best way to better learning but that is where you are wrong about it. You might think the strongest path possible lasts as long as possible. In order to make a good path, you have to make the most effort. Here you might get a doubt that studying one topic completely is tougher, the answer is no, studying multiple subjects or topics is a lot harder and takes a lot more effort and much effort boosts your learning.

Interleaving has shown to be more effective than blocked practise for developing skills of categorization and problem-solving: Interleaving also leads to better long-term retention and improved ability to transfer learned knowledge. This strategy forces the brain to continually retrieve for a reason that each practise is different from the last, so rote responses pulled from short-term won't work.
